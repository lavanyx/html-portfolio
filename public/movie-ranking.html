<h1>Lavanya's Top Picks : Show Edition </h1>
<h2>Top 3 Shows </h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Office</h3>
<p> This show is a light hearted culmination of all types of comedies and pranks. My comfort show indeed.</p>
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>This show is a realistic chain of events about mid life crisis of a cancer patient. Best part? The ending. (Not giving that as a spoiler!)</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>This is a beautiful blend of action,thrill,suspense and sentiments. The main theme of the show is quite serious but the show of mental strength,grit,determination and hard work put in by the protagonist is commendable and worth learning from. It is a very inspirational show.</p>
