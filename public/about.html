<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi ! I am Lavanya. I am an all rounder having the toxic habit of striving for perfection in everything that I do. This is me just being frank because I am tired of having set reply and introduction for my sunrise phase of career.I play tennis , learn coding , survived three years of engineering currently in fourth. I play tennis and I watch new content on majorly netflix and youtube.</p>

<p>I think playing tennis is one of my most important hobby. It alleviates my mood big time and helpes me stay positive and offcourse , FIT! I cannot imagine my life without it , hence I suggest everyone to inculcate this habit of exercising for their good only!</p>

<p>Well i told you about my hobby to remain positive but do I actually remain positive always? Nah! I am one of the most pessimistic people out here. I have a fair share of ups and downs and I mostly never know how to maneuvre through them. I am very much confused in my career and it often leads me to think am i doing what i like? I feel like that i dont know whether i like doing what i do right now , but i certainly am interested in giving life to some ideas i have been having in my mind for a while now.
  This brings me to the end of a short about me section. I hope you got to know me a little better. I am a very simple person with a lot of dreams and aspirations. I hope to achieve them all one day. I hope you have a great day ahead!
